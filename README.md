Repository Service for TUF helm charts

> We are looking for contributors to help improving these helm charts.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add rstuf https://repository-service-tuf.github.io/helm-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
rstuf` to see the charts.

To install the rstuf chart:

    helm install my-rstuf rstuf/rstuf

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete my-rstuf

### rstuf

This chart deploys a TUF repository service and all the required dependencies.
Check out the  `demo-values.yaml` file for an example of how to configure the
chart.
